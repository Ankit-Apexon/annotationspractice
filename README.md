In this practice, I have learned how to use different types of annotations such as @Controller, @RestController, <br>
@RequestMapping, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, @PathVariable, @RequestParam, @RequestBody, <br>
@ReponseBody, @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Autowired.
